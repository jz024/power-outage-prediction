# power outage prediction

# Framing the Problem

For this power outage dataset, we try to predict the cause of a major power outage. The response variable will be the CAUSE.CATEGORY column in the dataset; we choose it because we are trying to predict the cause of a power outage based on other parameters in the dataset (such as region, date, duration, etc.). This prediction will be a classification and we will use multi-class classification since there are multiple causes of power outages. We choose to use accuracy to evaluate our model because it measures the overall performance of the prediction based on the entire set of data. Each cause weighs the same so accuracy can be used to make sure that they contribute equally when calculating the accuracy value.
